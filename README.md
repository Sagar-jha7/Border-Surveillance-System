# Border Surveillance System
An AI-Based Intelligent Video Analytics Platform for Border Surveillance using existing CCTV Infrastructure
---
## Overview

The Border Surveillance System is an intelligent video analytics platform designed to enhance border security by leveraging existing CCTV infrastructure. It combines cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to detect, track, and alert security personnel of potential threats and anomalies in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Video Analysis**: Process live CCTV feeds in real-time using AI algorithms
- **Object Detection & Tracking**: Automatically detect and track people, vehicles, and other objects of interest
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify suspicious activities and unusual patterns
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Handle multiple CCTV feeds simultaneously
- **Alert System**: Generate instant alerts for detected threats and anomalies
- **Data Logging**: Comprehensive logging of events and incidents
- **Web Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for monitoring and management
- **Historical Analysis**: Review and analyze past incidents

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python** - Core AI/ML algorithms, video processing, and backend services
  - Computer Vision
  - REST API

### Frontend
- **JavaScript** - Interactive dashboard and user interface
- **HTML/CSS**  - Web interface structure and styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- CCTV camera feeds or video files for testing
- GPU support recommended (NVIDIA CUDA for faster processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sagar-jha7/Border-Surveillance-System.git
   cd Border-Surveillance-System
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Configure the system**
   - Edit `config/config.json` with your camera feed URLs
   - Set up database connections
   - Configure alert parameters

### Usage

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server** (if separate)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port)
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Add camera feeds and start monitoring

## Key Components

### Video Processing Engine
- Handles real-time frame extraction from multiple CCTV feeds
- Optimized for low-latency processing

### AI Detection Models
- Person detection and pose estimation
- Vehicle classification and tracking
- Anomaly detection algorithms

### Alert Management
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, in-app)
- Alert logging and history

### Web Dashboard
- Real-time video stream visualization
- Live alerts and notifications
- Historical data analysis
- System configuration and management

## API Endpoints

### Video Feeds
- `GET /api/feeds` - List all camera feeds
- `POST /api/feeds` - Add a new camera feed
- `GET /api/feeds/{id}` - Get specific feed details

### Detections
- `GET /api/detections` - Retrieve detected objects and events
- `GET /api/detections/{id}` - Get specific detection details

### Alerts
- `GET /api/alerts` - List all alerts
- `POST /api/alerts/config` - Configure alert settings

## Performance Metrics

- **Processing Latency**: < 100ms per frame (GPU)
- **Detection Accuracy**: 90%+ on standard datasets
- **Concurrent Streams**: Support for multiple simultaneous feeds
- **Uptime**: 24/7 monitoring capability

## Security Considerations

- Ensure CCTV feeds are accessed over secure connections (HTTPS/RTSP)
- Use strong authentication credentials
- Keep systems and dependencies updated
- Implement access control and user authentication
- Regular security audits recommended
